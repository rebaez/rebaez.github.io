A brief description of my github account, which is the account where I have all the repositorys for all the webpages I have and will create.
The last repository i created was about my car washing business webpage called Raf's car detailing business
I downloaded Desktop Gitbub, grabbed the repository I created on the webpage and cloned it into a folder. I then dragged all the files from my webpage and put them on my new suppository folder (which is local, on my desktop) commited the changes, and published it on the web-based Github.
